        <h2>Using the Power of the Nebraska N</h2>
        <p>
            Part of the goal of every University communication, regardless of the audience, is to 
            identify consistently and positively with the University. Using a Nebraska N icon lockup 
            is one way for any University department or unit to do just that. UNL Lockup Factory makes it easy to have an icon lockup created 
            so your unit can align with and take full advantage of the University’s strong brand.

        <h2>What is an “Icon Lockup?"</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                An icon lockup combines the University's “Nebraska N" icon with text describing a university department 
                or unit into one scalable image. This allows the text to be "locked in" to the correct position and size 
                next to the "N" in order to keep design consistent across the University for our audiences. Lockup files 
                can then be laid out in print materials, sent to merchandisers or used in websites. UNL Lockup Factory generates 
                images and vectors in RGB, Pantone, CMYK, and Black colors and includes all necessary file types and reversed 
                versions for use on dark backgrounds.

            <h2>How do I begin?</h2>
            <p>
                Click "Create a New Lockup" above. You'll need your UNL login credentials. 
                You'll then choose your lockup style and enter your text. You'll also want to know the "Communicator Contact" for your unit, 
                as both he/she and University Communications will approve the icon lockup. Once that's done, you can generate the files and 
                download a .zip package. Or, download individual files if you don't need them all. They will always be available here!
